# AnotherRustBevySnakeGame
Implementation of the game "Snake" in Rust with the help of Bevy engine. Most likely, no one needs it.

I created this project for educational purposes. It's a good idea to start your learning with a very simple project - probably any developer can create a snake in no time.

In retrospect, states that there was more to learning about the framework instead of the language. Plus, I haven't used the Rust features too much here.
But go ahead, you can be inspired by this project. I sincerely recommend the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine.
